# Overview
This project aims to predict Walmart sales across 45 stores using time series forecasting and analysis. The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter notebook environment.

# Data
The dataset used in this project contains historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores. It includes information such as date, store number, department number, weekly sales, and various other features.

# Methodology
* Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure consistency.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA is performed to understand the underlying patterns, trends, and seasonality in the data.
* Time Series Forecasting Models: Several time series forecasting models are implemented, including ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet, to predict future sales.
* Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
* Model Selection and Tuning: The best performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics, and hyperparameters are tuned to improve performance if necessary.
* Forecasting: The selected model is used to forecast sales for future time periods.
Files
* Jupyter Notebook: Contains the Python code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model implementation, evaluation, and forecasting.
